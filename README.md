An online divine practive about Jiaobei. Jiabei (筊杯) are wooden divination tools originating from China, which are used in pairs and thrown to seek divine guidance in the form of a yes or no question.<br/><br/>
There are three possible answers that the Jiaobei can produce:
1. Shèngjiǎo (圣筊, divine answer): One block flat and another block round is a 'yes' answer.

Méijiǎo (沒筊, no answer): Both blocks flat is a 'no' answer. It is said that the gods are displeased or show disagreement with the question, and this is shown in the way the blocks directly fall flat on the floor.
